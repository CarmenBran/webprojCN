                You don't need a whole lot of things to start, don't be scared by the multitude of tools you can see in the photo. Before you go
                ahead and start buying everyting, do your research.
                <br>
                Research is the key to success, I am impulsive and I didn't make a lot of research before buying and I found myself with a hundred
                things in my cabinet and no idea how to use them, so I went to my good friend Google and started researching how to use all the
                amazing stuff I had.
                <br>
                <br>
                Make sure you read a lot of blogs. Different creators will have different content, different tips and tricks, different perspective,
                it might all be different from one person to another. If you find somebody that you disagree with, don't be discuraged, keep looking,
                you will find the ones you resonate with and all the time you spend looking, will be worth the time.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another good friend of mine is Youtube, he is full of gems, start searching beginner's polymer clay earrings, you have hundreds of
                videos and content creators to choose from, they are awesome at explaining how to do it and you can also see it, which is always
                a plus.
                <br>
                <br>
                After all the research is done, and you are confident you want to start playing with polymer clay, make your purchase. Start easy
                with some cheap polymer clay bundle found on Amazon, it usually comes with the tools you need, which are pliers and cutter, and 
                earring loops, hooks and backings and you're ready to go. That's what I did anyway, I didn't expect to start doing amazing earrings
                from the first week, I knew it would take some hard practice before they start looking good enough to be worn outside of the house.
                <br>
                <br>
                And the last thing you need is patience and kindness: patience for a lot of hours spent in further research and practice practice
                practice. don't be discouraged when they come out bended or when you have layers they come out in the worst possible places. We all
                go through it in the beginning, it's absolutely normal. Think this way, <em>next time I will do it this way and see what comes out.</em>
                That's what's gonna get you through, kindness towards yourself and the learning process. It always looks easy on screen, until you
                have to get dirty and it's a mess.
                <br>
                <br>
                Don't forget, we trust you, we believe in you, we know you can do it, but if this is not for you, don't force it, find something that
                brings a fire in you and work it out.
