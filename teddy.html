                I cannot tell you enough how much I love these earrings. They are super cute and work for women and kids alike. And you can go
                in so many directions from here. Let's begin.
                <br>
                <br>
                What do you need:
                <old>
                    <li>Polymer clay</li>
                    <li>knife or cutter</li>
                    <li>Toothpick</li>
                    <li>Jewelry pliers</li>
                    <li>Hot glue or jewelry glue</li>
                    <li>Stud earring flatbacks or Earhooks and loops </li>
                </old>
                <br>
                <br>
                We start by choosing what colour will the teddy have. How about red? It's my favourite color. We make a ball out of it, big
                enough for the head, and another ball, small this time, for the ears, and we cut them in half with our knife or cutter. We
                leave the ears on the side and start with the head. We make 2 little circles to serve as eyes, one smaller circle to be the
                nose and the thinnest line to be the mouth. With the tip of our toothpick, we gently press them down on the spot we want
                them to be and make the hole for the loops using the toothpick, make sure that the hole is big enough for the loop, and the 
                remaining clay is thick enough to sustain some injuries. If you want to make studs instead, don't make the hole.
                <br>
                <br>
                You have passed the hardest part, now you just need to preheat the oven at 150Â°C for 10 minutes. In the meantime, prepare a
                tray with parchment paper and lay down your earrings. After the over has preheated, put your tray inside and let them cook
                for 20 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                After they are ready, is time to use hot glue gun or jewelry glue to put the ears in their place together. For stud earrings
                you need to glue the flatbacks to the teddy and put on the backing.
                For your drop earring you take the pliers and place a hoop in the hole you made with the toothpick. It is easier to hold the
                loop with one plier and close it with another. Try your best to keep it in a circle shape, afterwords place another loop and
                then put on the earhooks, and you're done.
                <br>
                I have received many questions as to why I use two loops, and I'll tell you the secret too, because it allowes the earring to
                fall in whichever direction it wants. If you use only one loop, it will stay in a weird way and the people around you will not
                really see the earring, they will see the side of it, if anything.
                <br>
                <br>
                So your teddy earrings are done, yeyy!! How did you find this project? This is my second favourite project to do, the second
                photo was my very first teddy, kinda creppy if you ask me, I pressed the left eye a bit too hard and it came out as if it was
                a pirate eye patch haha, and to think I spent no less than two hours trying to figure out how can I do it, but hey the rest of
                them are alright. Send me an email with your teddies, what colour combination did you use? How long did it take you?
                <br>
                <br>
                And as always, have a wonderful day!
