                Hello and welcome to A's Corner. I am Carmen, I am originally from Romania, but I now live in the UK with my partner, Bryan, and our
                two little girls. <em>(Alessia and Amy, get it?)</em> Becoming a mother was the one thing I didn't know I needed until I had it,
                I love is so much, but it's so draining. They require all of my attention 24/7, and that makes me a bit tense. One evening I was scrolling
                through Youtube and I found a video with somebody doing polymer clay earrings, and I said, <em>what in the world is that?</em> I think,
                that was the moment Bryan realised our pockets will get slightly lighter and cabinets slightly fuller, and boy was he right. I started
                researching more and more about this wonderful thing I used to play with when I was a kid and absolutely loved it, and shortly after, I 
                had everything I needed to start. And so the journey had begun.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whilst Amy is too small to give an opinion <em>(not born yet)</em>, Alessia loves to pick out colours, to play with my
                tools which is always fun to supervise, she particularly enjoys mixing the clay.
                <br>
                Having my daughter interested in what I do and trying to help me or just mess about brings me so much joy, because I know,
                in the long term, we will be bonding together over this, it will be our little thing to share, no boys involved haha.
                <br>
                <br>
                Soon after the bundle arrived, <em>(few hours later)</em>, the first batch with one singular earring was ready, the result: <strong>horrific</strong>, 
                and I couldn't be prouder haha.
                I'm getting sidetracked, the point was polymer clay became therapeutic to some degree and my "me" time, it takes a lot of time, practice,
                materials, but you'll love the products, and you have cute Christmas gifts too.
                <br/>

                to receive a message from you, with questions or just to say hi.
