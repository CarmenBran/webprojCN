                This is the most ambitious project we have attempted so far and my alltime favourite, and definitely the most complicate and
                intricate design.
                Are you ready?
                <br>
                <br>
                What do you need:
                <old>
                    <li>brown, dark green, and lime polymer clay</li>
                    <li>Silicone mould if had</li>
                    <li>knife or cutter</li>
                    <li>Toothpick</li>
                    <li>pen or pin</li>
                    <li>Jewelry pliers</li>
                    <li>Hot glue or jewelry glue</li>
                    <li>Stud earring flatbacks or Earhooks and loops </li>
                </old>
                <br>
                <br>
                If you have the silicone with the avocado, then you know your avocado will be big and fairly flat. I made both designs and I
                prefer the ones made without the mould, but let's give it a go, let you deside for yourself which one you like best. 
                For the mould you press down the polymer clay, be careful you have 2 different colors. the lime, which is the actual avocado
                and goes inside <em>(if you don't have this color you can make it with a litlte bit of green and a lot of white)</em>
                and the dark green which is the cover.
                <br>
                Start by flatening and cutting the dark green out, not more than 1mm and start the layering with the brown clay aka the seed
                of the avocado, continue with the lime green, followed by the dark green. Don't worry if the dark green does not fit properly,
                you can cut the excess off when the layering has finished. Leave it there for 5 second, no longer because it will start to
                harden and break when you try to make the hole for the earring's loop. After you carefully took it out, you can decide what 
                type of earrings you want: a stud or a drop. If you want to do a drop earring, after removing the polymer clay from its mould,
                take a toothpick and make a hole <em>(fairly big)</em> where you want the earrings hook to be. Make sure that you leave enough
                clay up top so it is strong enough to sustain a fall or two. If you want studs, we continue after they bake.
                <br>
                <br>
                You have passed the hardest part, now you just need to preheat the oven at 150Â°C for 10 minutes. In the meantime, prepare a
                tray with parchment paper and lay down your earrings. After the over has preheated, put your tray inside and let them cook
                for 20 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                After they are ready, let them cool of. For studs you need to use the hot glue gun or the jewelry glue to put the flatbacks,
                and then you just need to put on the backings and they are done.
                For drop earrings, you still have a few more steps. Now you take the pliers and place a hoop in the hole you made with the toothpick.
                It is easier to hold the loop with one plier and close it with another. Try your best to keep it in a circle shape, afterwords
                place another loop and then finish it off with the earhooks, and you're done.
                <br>
                I have received many questions as to why I use two loops, and I'll tell you the secret too, because it allowes the earring to
                fall in whichever direction it weants. If you use only one loop, it will stay in a weird way and the people around you will not
                really see the earring, they will see the side of it, if anything.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now let's talk about how you can make these earrings without the mould. Buckle up, it's going to be a bumpy ride.
                <br>
                Let's start with the lime green, which is the delicious part of the avocado,we make a ball out of it and cover it with the dark
                green, and make it a nice ball. We take the knife or the cutter and cut it in half, make sure your blade is new and in great shape
                otherwise it will distort the shape like in my photo's case, and your avocados will not look their best. Afterwords, we can start
                giving our avocado the usual pear-like shape. We take the tool with round head, or a fork and start making a round-ish hole in the
                center for the seed. Take the brown clay and make a ball out of it and fill out the gap you made.
                Our avocado is almost ready, here comes the cute part I enjoy the most. Time to give this fruit some texture. Let's take our toothpick
                and start making lines top to bottom on the seed. On its cover we are going to do small indentations (with the toothpick) about 2mm
                long all over the place, in all directions, just go wild, it will make it look so much more realistic. Now let's make the hole for 
                the loop if you are going to make drop earrings, if you are making studs, just flatten the back side a little bit so you can
                properly fit the flatbacks. Let's bake them quickly and put the flatbacks and the backings, or for drop earrings let's put the loops
                and the earhook.
                <br>
                Oh my goodness, this has been a roller coaster, I did tell you these are hard, look at my avocados, you can tell they are handmade
                by a beginner haha, in all fairness those were my very first avocados and I still have them as a reminder of how far I've come.
                But which design did you enjoy more? How did yours come out? Did you enjoy this project? How long did it take you? TELL ME EVERYTHING!
                <br>
                <br>
                As always, have a wonderful day and I'll see you next time!
