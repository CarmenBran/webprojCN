                When I first saw a polymer clay croissant earring I was shocked, and thought this is going to be so complicated with all the
                details that it has, the color, everything is so complicated.
                <br>
                <br>
                What do you need:
                <old>
                    <li>White polymer clay</li>
                    <li>knife or cutter</li>
                    <li>Toothpick</li>
                    <li>Jewelry pliers</li>
                    <li>Hot glue or jewelry glue</li>
                    <li>Stud earring flatbacks or Earhooks and loops </li>
                </old>
                <br>
                <br>
                I think you saw it, for this project we will use white polymer clay, yes WHITE, and you will see how it turns out brown,
                be patient. We start with creating a flat sheet of clay about 1.5mm thick, you can use a pin or a pen if you don't have the pin.
                Now take the cutter or the knife and cut a triangle, 2cm wide and 4-5cm tall. Starting from the widest part, start rolling
                it until you reach the end, bend it at the middle and you have a croissant. Take the toothpick and make a whole large enough
                to allow the loop to go through it and also jiggle around.
                <br>
                <br>
                The hard job is now finished, we still have a problem, the crissant is white. Take our your makeup bag, don't ask questions, just
                bring it, take out a makeup pallette with brown eyeshadow, I know you have it, even if the last you used it was a few years ago,
                it's perfect for this job. Take out the creese brush, fluffy round tipped one, and gently dab it on your croissant, that will bring
                uneven coloring and a cute and subtle texture. Now they are ready to be baked! Preheat the oven at at 150Â°C for 10 minutes. In
                the meantime, prepare a tray with parchment paper and lay down your earrings. After the over has preheated, put your tray inside
                and let them cook for 20 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                After they are ready, let them cool of. The rest of the process is always going to be the same, if you want stud earrings then
                take the hot glue gun or the jewelry glue and stick your flatbacks to the croisants, don't forget about the backings and you're
                all done. For your drop earrings, you still have a few more steps. You take the pliers and place a hoop in the hole you made
                with the toothpick. It is easier to hold the loop with one plier and close it with another. Try your best to keep it in a circle
                shape, afterwords place another loop and then finish it off with the earhooks, and you're done.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have received many questions as to why I use two loops, and I'll tell you the secret too, because it allowes the earring to
                fall in whichever direction it wants. If you use only one loop, it will stay in a weird way and the people around you will not
                really see the earring, they will see the side of it, if anything.
                <br>
                <br>
                To be fair, these ones are a bit harder, I managed to do a few good ones, and then I sort of lost my mojo and they went bad bad bad.
                But how did yours come out? Send me an email with your croisants, I'd love to see them. I hope you enjoyed this project, and you had
                fun doing it.
                <br>

                As always, have a wonderful day! P.S. What do you think about my cute packaging?
