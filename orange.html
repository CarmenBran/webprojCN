                Creating the outside of an orange as an earring is quite simple and very good for a first project. Either you are lucky 
                like me and receive with your bundle a silicone mould with fruits or you can buy one, or you can do it without, I'll show you.
                <br>
                <br>
                What do you need:
                <old>
                    <li>Orange and green polymer clay</li>
                    <li>Silicone mould if had</li>
                    <li>knife or cutter</li>
                    <li>Toothpick</li>
                    <li>Jewelry pliers</li>
                    <li>Hot glue or jewelry glue</li>
                    <li>Stud earring flatbacks or Earhooks and loops </li>
                </old>
                <br>
                <br>
                You don't need all the items listed above, it only depends on what type of earring you want. In general you can do 2 types,
                and we will talk about them in a second. Let's start the process, shall we.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you have the silicone, you just press down the polymer clay in the mould and leave it there for 5 second, not too long,
                because it will start to harden and break when you try to make the hole for the earring's loop. After carefully taking it out,
                you will decide what type of earrings do you want: a stud or a drop. If you want to do a drop earring, after removing
                the polymer clay from its mould, take a toothpick and make a hole <em>(fairly big)</em> where you want the earring hook to be.
                Make sure that you leave enough clay up top so it is strong enough to sustain a fall or two, if you want a stud earring, we will
                continue them after they cook.
                <br>
                <br>
                You have passed the hardest part, now you just need to preheat the oven at 150Â°C for 10 minutes. In the meantime, prepare a
                tray with parchment paper and lay down your earrings. After the over has preheated, put your tray inside and let them cook
                for 20 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                After they are ready, let them cool of. If you want a stud put hot glue or jewelry glue on the orange, followed quickly by the
                flatback, and now let it dry for a while. Your stud earrings are done, you just need to put on the backing. For your
                drop earring, you still have a few more steps. Now you take the pliers and place a hoop in the hole you made with the toothpick.
                It is easier to hold the loop with one plier and close it with another. Try your best to keep it in a circle shape, afterwords
                place another loop and then finish it off with the earhooks, and you're done.
                <br>
                I have received many questions as to why I use two loops, and I'll tell you the secret too, because it allowes the earring to
                fall in whichever direction it wants. If you use only one loop, it will stay in a weird way and the people around you will not
                really see the earring, they will see the side of it, if anything.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now let's talk about how you can make these earrings without the mould. Take the orange clay and make a circle about the size you
                want your earrings to be. Afterwards, take the knife or cutter (depending on what you have) and cut it in half, use a very sharp
                knife so it doesn't distort the shape too much. Now take the toothpick and literally puncture the soon to be orange, give it 
                texture, leave some indentations on it, it doesn't have to be a perfect circle.  And now the process is the same, baking, and
                placing the flatbacks or the loops and hoops.
                <br>
                You're all done! How did it go? Did you enjoy it? Which style did you go with? Send me an email, I'd love to see how you did it
                and if you have any tips and tricks to make it easier. I loved making oranges, most of my friends have some haha.
                Keep practicing and I'll see you next time.
                <br>
                <br>
                As always, have a wonderful day!
