                Now we are getting a bit intricate with our designs. Today we are going to do pineapple earrings.
                <br>
                <br>
                What do you need:
                <old>
                    <li>Orange and green polymer clay</li>
                    <li>Silicone mould if had</li>
                    <li>knife or cutter</li>
                    <li>Toothpick</li>
                    <li>Jewelry pliers</li>
                    <li>Hot glue or jewelry glue</li>
                    <li>Stud earring flatbacks or Earhooks and loops </li>
                </old>
                <br>
                <br>
                No introduction to this one, let's dive right into it because it's a bit tricky!
                If you have the silicone you just press down the polymer clay in the mould and leave it there for 5 second, not too long,
                because it will start to harden and break when you try to make the hole for the earring's loop. After you carefully took it
                out, you will decide what type of earrigns do you want: a stud or a drop. If you want to do drop earrings,after removing
                the polymer clay from its mould, take a toothpick and make a hole <em>(fairly big)</em> where you want the earring hook to be.
                Make sure that you leave enough clay up top so it is strong enough to sustain a fall or two. If you want a stud, we will 
                continue after they bake.
                <br>
                <br>
                You have passed the hardest part, now you just need to preheat the oven at 150Â°C for 10 minutes. In the meantime, prepare a
                tray with parchment paper and lay down your earrings. After the over has preheated, put your tray inside and let them cook
                for 20 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                After they are ready, let them cool of. If you decided on stud earrings, take the flatbacks and glue them together with hot
                glue gun or jewelry glue, put on the backing and you are all set. If you decided to go for drop earrings you still have a few
                 more steps. Now you take the pliers and place a hoop in the hole you made with the toothpick. It is easier to hold the loop
                with one plier and close it with another. Try your best to keep it in a circle shape, afterwords place another loop and then
                finish it off with the earhooks, and you're done.
                <br>
                I have received many questions as to why I use two loops, and I'll tell you the secret too, because it allowes the earring to
                fall in whichever direction it wants. If you use only one loop, it will stay in a weird way and the people around you will not
                really see the earring, they will see the side of it, if anything.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now let's talk about how you can make this earrings without the mould. Take the orange clay and make a circle about the side you
                want your earring to be. Now take the knife or cutter (depending on what you have) and cut it in half, use a very sharp
                knife so it doesn't distort the shape too much. Now take the toothpick and start drawing circles, more or less the same size,
                in rows, like my pictures. Now is the tricky part, draw diagonal lines so every line follows a line of circles, so it has a more
                natural look.
                Let's do some leaves now. take a teeny tiny bit of green polymer clay and cut about 8-10 pieces that you can turn into cilinders,
                and stick them together so it looks like a little bouquette. Take the glue and glue the pineapple to the leaves and let them dry
                for a while. From here on now the process is the same, preheat the oven, bake, cool off and if you want studs you know what to do,
                and if you want to drops you know what to do.
                <br>
                <br>
                That's it! The pineapples are ready to be worn. I did not make any studs, because in general I prefer drop earrings, but to each
                their own. I love seeing both or them though, so send me an email, I'm so excited for you.
                <br>

                As always, have a wonderful day!
